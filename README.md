In the Shoot Weapon Script, I make it so that whenever the player hits the Trigger button, the Gunshot Sound is triggered

In the Start Ambience Script, I make it so that when the scene is initialized, it will play my Maze Ambience Sound

In the SpawnManager Script I make it so that whenever an enemy is hit it plays the Enemy Death Pop Sound

On all of my Coins in my game I have an Audio Source that loops and has a linear rolloff to trigger and play a shiny sound when you get in close proximity of it

In the Invisible Script, I make it so that whenever the coins turn invisible the CoinDeposit Sound is played
